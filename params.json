If you have more than 10 million gists, you need to modify the source of `gister` yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### publish\r\n\r\nWhenever you want to publish a gist, just use\r\n\r\n    gister description file.txt ...\r\n\r\nThis will create the gist with the provided description, clone the gist repo, put the gistid to clipborad, and open the url in your `x-www-browser`.\r\n\r\nNote: you must provide gist description, otherwise `gister` will fail.\r\n\r\nHint: `gister` will pass all arguments to gist as `gist -c -o -d description ...`, so you can use other options that gist understands, e.g. `gister descrption -P` will work.\r\n\r\nIf you've edited your gists at `gist.github.com` or local machine, without pull/push changesets, you can sync all your gists via `gister sync`.\r\n\r\nIf you've deleted your gists at `gist.github.com`, after `gister sync`, the directories of deleted gists at your local machine will be marked with a prefix `_`.\r\n\r\n### search\r\n\r\nSearch all of your gists:\r\n\r\n    gister search regexp\r\n\r\n\r\n### migrate\r\n\r\nFrom version 1.0.0, `gister` uses a different storage structure.\r\nIf you have used `gister <1.0.0`, then you need to run this command to migrate:\r\n\r\n    gister migrate\r\n\r\n\r\nStorage\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    /path/to/your/gists\r\n    |-- gists.list  # a list of all your gists (including meta info) \r\n    |-- repo # git repositories of your gists\r\n    |-- tree # working directory of your gist repositories\r\n        |-- 123456 # an example of gist\r\n        |-- _123567890 # an example of gist which you have deleted on gist.github.com\r\n        |-- ...\r\n    `-- .csearchindex # code search index\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nFork and/or send pull requests or issues on github: https://github.com/weakish/gister\r\n",
